# Chips App

Just test task. Build based on create react app. 

Chips component renders chips in one line. If in this line not enough spaces for all chips, renders only only those chips that fit in this line and also renders chip with dots. When usr click on dots, he can see rest extra chips in popover(fast implementation, unfortunately not closed on outside click). Any chip can be selected or deselected by clicking on an already active chip.


## For start project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
